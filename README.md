# JavaScript FAQ Accordion

This is a simple and responsive "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) accordion component built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The project's main goal is to practice and demonstrate fundamental JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques.

## Key Features

  * **Accordion Logic:** Clicking a question title expands its corresponding answer by adding a `show-text` class.
  * **One-at-a-Time:** Only one answer can be displayed at a time. Clicking a new question automatically collapses any previously opened one.
  * **Dynamic Icons:** The plus (`+`) and minus (`-`) icons automatically swap using CSS to visually indicate whether a section is open or closed.
  * **Responsive Design:** The component layout adjusts for different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop, using media queries.
  * **Pure Vanilla JS:** All interactivity is handled with clean, modern, "vanilla" JavaScript. No external libraries are needed for the core logic.
  * **Semantic HTML:** Uses semantic HTML5 markup for structure.
